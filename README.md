üîç Key Analyses Conducted
Booking Trends

Bookings by month and year

Distribution of lead time

Arrival date analysis

Revenue & Stay Metrics

Average Daily Rate (ADR)

Total Revenue by segment

Nights stayed by guests

Cancellations

Cancellation rates by market segment and month

Booking characteristics of canceled vs. non-canceled guests

Customer Segmentation

Distribution of guests by type (Transient, Group, Contract)

Booking trends for repeat vs. new customers

Seasonality & Location

Monthly booking and revenue trends

Differences between city hotel and resort hotel branches

Sample Insights
Most bookings occur in the summer months, indicating a strong seasonality effect.

City hotels outperform resort hotels in revenue but have a higher cancellation rate.

Repeat guests have shorter lead times and lower cancellation tendencies.

Group bookings are more likely to cancel and tend to book further in advance.
